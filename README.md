## About Me

I’m a self-taught software engineer with a strong backend focus, building production-grade systems for web, mobile, and desktop.

Linux and open-source have been my home my entire career. I care deeply about **performance, simplicity, and shipping real products** — not demos. Most of my work lives at the intersection of backend APIs, server-side rendered frontends, and systems that are easy to deploy, maintain, and scale.

I’ve worked as a consultant, lead developer, and indie builder, owning projects end-to-end from architecture to deployment.

## What I Build

- API-driven backend systems  
- Server-side rendered web applications  
- Cross-platform mobile & desktop apps  
- Indie games and creative tools  
- Open-source developer tooling  

I prefer boring, reliable infrastructure and clean architecture over clever abstractions.
