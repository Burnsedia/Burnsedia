# Hey, I'm Burnsedia!

> Full-stack developer, indie hacker, and open-source builder.

## About Me

Self-taught developer.
Linux and open-source enthusiast 
Software Engineering has been my entire career. 
I build fast, clean, full-stack systems with a focus on performance, simplicity, and shipping real products.

## Tech Stack

- Godot Engine — mobile & desktop games  
- Vue.js — frontend 
- Flutter — cross-platform mobile & desktop  
- Python & Django — API design & backend systems  
- LangChain — AI workflows & agentic tools  

## Editor & Environment

- Neovim — my daily driver  
- Arch Linux — *btw*  

## My Journey

I started programming at 9 by modding Command & Conquer. After high school, I moved directly into freelance work—building websites, applications, and games from the ground up.
That foundation grew into a career shipping production software across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.
Now I build and ship indie tools, apps, and games with a focus on clean design and continuous improvement.
