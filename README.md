I am your typical nerd who builds FOSS apps and games.

Here are the Technologies I use:

  - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for Real Work
  - [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) for Fun
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for large clients
  - [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for everything else 

I love this Editors and IDEs:
  - [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  - [Lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) is my main IDE these days
