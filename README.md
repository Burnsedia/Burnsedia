# Hey, I'm Burnsedia!

> Full-stack developer, indie hacker, and open-source builder.

## About Me

Self-taught Linux and open-source developer.  
I started coding at 9 by modding Command & Conquer, and after high school I went straight into freelancing—building websites, apps, and my own games.  

Software Engineering has been my entire career. I build fast, clean, full-stack systems with a focus on performance, simplicity, and shipping real products.

## Tech Stack

- Godot Engine — mobile & desktop games  
- Vue.js — frontend SPAs & dashboards  
- Flutter — cross-platform mobile & desktop  
- Python & Django — API design & backend systems  
- LangChain — AI workflows & agentic tools  

## Editor & Environment

- Neovim — my daily driver  
- Arch Linux — *btw*  

## My Journey

Started as a kid modifying strategy games.  
Turned that obsession into a career building software for the web, mobile, and desktop.  
Now I ship indie tools, apps, and games while refining my craft one commit at a time.
