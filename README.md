# Hey, I'm Burnsedia!

> Autistic nerd turned fullstack developer

## About Me

Linux and open-source enthusiast. Former basement apartment dweller, now living proof that you can rewrite your story, embrace your quirks, and make a real impact.

Proudly autistic and neurodiverse. I worked my way out of poverty, one line of code at a time—leveling up my style, mindset, and skills through self-improvement and personal growth.


## Tech Stack

- Godot Engine — mobile & desktop games
- Vue.js — frontend magic
- Flutter — cross-platform apps
- Python & Django — backend wizardry
- LangChain — AI workflows

## Editor & Environment

- Neovim — my daily driver
- Arch Linux — *btw*

## My Journey

From poverty and stereotype to confidence and independence.  
If you’re passionate about learning, digital freedom, or open-source—welcome!
