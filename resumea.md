## About

I’m a senior full-stack developer and consultant with a strong backend focus, building production SaaS systems, APIs, and real-time applications.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **Node.js**, **Python/Django**, and modern frontend frameworks, with a heavy emphasis on **server-side rendering, containerization, and clean system architecture**. I’ve led and delivered projects for early-stage startups and established clients, owning everything from backend APIs and data models to deployment pipelines and infrastructure decisions.

### What I Work On

I build applications that are designed to last.

That usually means:
- API-driven backends
- Server-side rendered frontends
- Dockerized deployments
- Clear separation between business logic and presentation
- Infrastructure that can scale without becoming fragile

I’ve delivered SaaS platforms using **Astro and Vue.js in SSR mode (Node.js)**, backend systems with **Django and PostgreSQL**, and full **MERN-stack** applications. My projects are typically containerized with Docker and deployed using cloud infrastructure mapped to **AWS services**.

### Professional Experience

I’ve worked as a consultant and lead developer on multiple production systems, including:

- **Limelite** – Building and maintaining backend APIs with Django REST Framework, integrating Astro/Vue frontends, and managing Docker-based deployments.
- **DeepRootsCoop** – Acting as lead developer on a pre-seed startup, delivering a full SaaS platform with SSR frontends, Django backends, PostgreSQL, and cloud infrastructure.
- **TheHub.systems** – Consulting on backend architecture using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express, alongside real-time systems built with Rust and WebSockets.
- **initPro.dev** – Developing MERN-stack applications and supporting Django services in production environments.

Across these projects, I’ve worked with CI/CD pipelines, cloud deployments, and production monitoring, with a strong emphasis on documentation and maintainability.

### Beyond Client Work

Outside of client and SaaS work, I also build:

- **Indie games using the Godot Engine**, focusing on systems-driven design and performance-conscious architecture.
- **Cross-platform applications in Flutter**, sharing code across mobile and desktop while integrating with backend APIs.

These projects sharpen my systems thinking and keep me close to performance, state management, and user experience concerns that translate directly back into backend and platform work.

### How I Approach Software

I care about:
- Correctness over cleverness
- Boring, reliable infrastructure
- Systems that are easy to reason about
- Codebases that can be maintained by someone else six months later

I’m comfortable owning projects end-to-end, from architecture and implementation through deployment and iteration.

If you’re looking for someone who can build, ship, and maintain real software — not just prototypes — that’s where I do my best work.
